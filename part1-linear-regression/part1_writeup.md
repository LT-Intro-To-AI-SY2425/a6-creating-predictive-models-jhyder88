# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
0.626 --> Not the most accurate
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
137.46185286
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
Not the most accurate as r^2 is only 0.62, which leaves room for improvement. I wouldn't say the model is accurate enough to predict someone's blood preassure as a 60% success rate leaves close to 40% chance of being wrong. Adding more data points seems like it'd fix this issue.
