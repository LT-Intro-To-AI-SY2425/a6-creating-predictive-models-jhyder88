# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
Splitting the testing data between test and training helps with model efficiency. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The accuracy of the model, closer to 1 would make it more accurate and thus more reliable.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
No, similarly to the last model the r^2 value is still in the 0.6 range, which leaves solid room for error.
