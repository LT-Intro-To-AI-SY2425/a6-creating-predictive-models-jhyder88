# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
Red = Frugal-Least income value + spending score
Blue = Shopaholic-Most income value + spending score
Orange = Stupid-Low income + High spending score
Green = Average-Median income + spending score
Purple = Cheap-High income + low spending score

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
Green
3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
Purple is an interesting group that I'd assume marketing teams would look to appeal towards due to their high amounts of money. Perhaps marketing teams could deploy a run of sales on nice products, which would hopefully get this cluster group to become a fan of this product/company and therefore be more willing to spend more to acquire said good.
